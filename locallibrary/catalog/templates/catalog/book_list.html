<!-- We use the if, else, and endif template tags to check whether the book_list has been
 defined and is not empty. If book_list is empty, then the else clause displays text
explaining that there are no books to list. If book_list is not empty, then we iterate
through the list of books.
 -->



 <!-- The template uses the for and endfor template tags to loop through the book list, as shown below.
  Each iteration populates the book template variable with information for the current list item.

 {% for book in book_list %}
   <li>  code here get information from each book item  </li>
 {% endfor %}
 While not used here, within the loop Django will also create other variables that you can use to track the iteration
 . For example, you can test the forloop.last variable to perform conditional processing the last time that the loop is run. -->
